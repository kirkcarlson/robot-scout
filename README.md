Robot-scout has two parts: An HTML/CSS/JS based scouting tool to input data about a match and the movement of a robot during a match. A python-based server for analyzing the information collected. The server can be expanded to be a true server to serve match data to the scouting tool client and information about matches to analysis clients.

This is basically a stop-watch that keeps track of six splits during a cycle and multiple cycles during a match. The idea is to time these activities for comparison and improvements. This reflects the FRC 2023 season.
